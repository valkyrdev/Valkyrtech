This file is not loaded as a config; it is here to document the parameters and explain the configs' use.
CaveControl uses the LuaBlock system, meaning one or more prototypes/definitions are defined similar to lua tables.
These blocks can be defined in any order, spread across any number of valid files (.txt, .lua, .ini, .cfg, .yml).
Each block has a number of required parameters, detailed below:
===========================================================================
"type": The ID of the biome for which the definition applies. IDs are determined based on the biome name and ID;
For example, vanilla plains would be 1#Plains, and mega taiga is 32#MegaTaiga
To specify by ID only, use '*' for the name.
Note that mutated and subbiomes (eg Ice Spikes (Ice Plains), ForestHills, Extreme Hills Edge, and Flower Forest) cannot have their own definitions; they inherit from the parent biome.

"inherit": Unspecified parameters are inherited from this parent. This prevents you from having to redefine all of the parameters
repeatedly when only changing one or two values. Inheritance is normally from 'global', which is the base data used for all biomes.
These two parameters MUST be specified.
===========================================================================
Cave generation parameters:
"density":           	Cave Density Multiplier       	(vanilla and default = 1.0)
"ravines":           	Ravine Frequency Multiplier   	(vanilla and default = 1.0)
"mineshafts":        	Mineshafts Frequency Multiplier	(vanilla and default = 1.0)
"dungeons":          	Dungeon Spawn Factor          	(vanilla and default = 1.0)
"gen_strongholds":   	Generate Strongholds          	(vanilla and default = true)
"lava_caves":        	Fill Deep Caves with Lava     	(vanilla and default = true)
"water_caves":       	Fill Deep Caves with Water    	(vanilla and default = false)
"cave_size":         	Cave Node Size Multiplier     	(vanilla and default = 1.0)
"large_cave_chance": 	Large Cave Node Chance        	(vanilla and default = 25.0)
"large_cave_size":   	Large Cave Node Size Factor   	(vanilla and default = 1.0)
"large_cave_variance":	Large Cave Node Size Variance 	(vanilla and default = 6.0)
"min_y":             	Cave Generation Y Min         	(vanilla and default = 0)
"max_y":             	Cave Generation Y Max         	(vanilla and default = 256)
"vscale":            	Vertical Scale Factor         	(vanilla and default = 1.0)
===========================================================================
Consult global.lua for an example definition file. Feel free to modify it as the base template from which others extend,
but it should always have one and only one definition - that of the base template.
Note: If a biome has no specific template specified, it entirely uses the behavior defined in global.
